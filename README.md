# 📦 Formation Control Mechatronics Project

This project presents a warehouse automation solution using **three autonomous mobile robots** that work collaboratively to transport a shared load along a **predefined path**.

A **top-view camera system** provides real-time vision feedback, enabling coordinated **formation control** for efficient and reliable inventory handling.
